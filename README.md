just a repo with my current projects open for everyone to see and or review.

Current projects:

Keylogger
  Simple keylogger to log all keyboard inputs, will be put on my home server to make sure no one has access to it except me.

    get MAC and or IP address of the user to identify the device.

  run the python script
  log.txt file will be created with all the keyboard inputs that were typed while the script was running
